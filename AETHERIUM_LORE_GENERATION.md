# Aetherium: Artifact & Creature Generation Log

This document serves as a log of the initial generation prompts and descriptions used to create the visual and thematic elements of the Aetherium world. This history is intended to guide AI-driven asset generation (2D images, 3D models).

## Artifacts and Devices

### 1. Golem Core (Ядро Голема)
*   **Proposed Filename:** `golem_core_xiao.glb`
*   **Visual Description:**
    *   **Concept:** A dormant technological artifact, a source of pure logical power.
    *   **Materials:** Polished black obsidian or a smooth, matte black ceramic composite. Internal circuits are made of silver or platinum.
    *   **Form:** A small rectangular plate, the size of a large thumb.
    *   **Details:** Beneath the smooth surface, a complex network of fine silver conductors is visible, resembling a sleeping nervous system. In its inactive state, it is cold to the touch. When activated, the conductors pulse with a soft blue or white light, and the core emits a quiet, rhythmic hum. Along the long edges are rows of tiny, perfectly machined gold contacts, hinting at connectivity.

### 2. Phylactery of True Sight (Филактерий Истинного Зрения)
*   **Proposed Filename:** `phylactery_of_true_sight.glb`
*   **Visual Description:**
    *   **Concept:** A magical amplifier that awakens the Golem Core's potential, focusing it on perceiving neural energy.
    *   **Materials:** A disc of translucent milky quartz or moonstone. Runes and inlays are made of gold. Gemstones are set in the center.
    *   **Form:** A perfectly round disc, designed to be placed on top of the Golem Core.
    *   **Details:** The surface is covered with concentric golden runes that faintly glow with a violet light. At the center is the main artifact—the **Crystal of Immaculate Mind (ADS131M08)**, a square, faceted obsidian crystal that seems to absorb light. Around it, like jewels in a crown, are smaller **Heartstones (LDO)** and a **Crystal of Time (oscillator)**, each glowing with its unique color. On the underside of the disc is a circle of ten **Golden Contact Spines (pogo pins)**, designed to read neural signals. When activated, thin arcs of violet energy run between the runes and the central crystal.

### 3. Harmonic Resonance Cable (Кабель Гармонического Резонанса)
*   **Proposed Filename:** `harmonic_resonance_cable.glb`
*   **Visual Description:**
    *   **Concept:** Not just a wire, but a magical conductor that synchronizes the essence of multiple artifacts.
    *   **Materials:** A braided cord of three mystical materials: one strand of a metal resembling liquid mercury (symbolizing ground/GND), a second of spun gold that pulses with warm light (power/VCC), and a third of crystalline fiber that changes color (signal/REF).
    *   **Form:** A flexible braided cable with intricate connectors at the ends, made from brass and jade.

### 4. Mind-Matrix (Матрица Разума)
*   **Proposed Filename:** `mind_matrix_quad.glb` (for 4 phylacteries)
*   **Visual Description:**
    *   **Concept:** A powerful, unified device, a synergy of multiple Phylacteries.
    *   **Details:** Several Phylacteries, floating in the air and arranged in a dense cluster or a vertical stack. They are connected by glowing Harmonic Resonance Cables. The entire structure slowly rotates and hums with contained power. The glow of each Phylactery is synchronized, pulsing in a single rhythm. A spherical aura of violet and blue energy flows is visible around the Matrix, within which complex light patterns flash.

## Reagents (Crafting Materials)

*   **Proposed Filename:** `reagent_crystal_of_time_ecs2520mv.glb`
*   **Description:** A small rectangular crystal in a metallic case made of electrum (an alloy of gold and silver). Through a tiny quartz window on the top face, the crystal itself is visible, vibrating at a high frequency, emitting a silvery shimmer and a barely audible, pure tone.

### 4. Spore of Ley-Capacitor (Спора Лей-Конденсатора)
*   **Source Component:** SMD Capacitors
*   **Proposed Filename:** `reagent_ley_capacitor_spore_0603.glb`
*   **Description:** A tiny, smooth, ceramic-like seed or spore of rectangular shape. Its color varies from light beige to dark brown. It has metallic "caps" on its ends. It seems inert, but begins to glow faintly when brought near a source of magic.

### 5. Golden Contact Spine (Золотой Контактный Шип)
*   **Source Component:** Pogo Pin
*   **Proposed Filename:** `reagent_golden_contact_spine_pogo.glb`
*   **Description:** A thin, needle-like spike of pure, polished gold. The base is a wider cylinder for mounting, and the tip is spring-loaded and rounded. Designed for soft, temporary contact and the transmission of ethereal energy.

### 6. Tablet of Logical Weaving (Скрижаль Логического Плетения)
*   **Source Component:** Pin Header
*   **Proposed Filename:** `reagent_tablet_logical_weaving_header.glb`
*   **Description:** A small plate of a black, ebony-like material from which a row of seven perfectly straight metal pins with a square cross-section protrudes. Faintly glowing blue lines forming logical circuits are engraved on the plate itself.

## World and Creatures

### 1. The Alchemist's Forge (Алхимическая Кузница)
