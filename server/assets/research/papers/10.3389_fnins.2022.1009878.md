## Summary

This research paper explores the use of a novel ultra-high-density electroencephalography (uHD EEG) system to decode individual finger movements. The core idea is that increasing the spatial resolution of EEG sensors can significantly improve the ability to distinguish precise body motions, a task that is challenging for conventional EEG systems.

### Key Innovations & Findings:

1.  **uHD EEG System:** The study used a system with 256 channels densely distributed over the sensorimotor cortex, achieving an inter-electrode distance of just 8.6 mm, compared to 60-65 mm in standard EEG setups. This was achieved using flexible electrode grids attached directly to the scalp with medical adhesives.
2.  **Experiment:** Five healthy subjects performed single finger extensions based on visual cues. The brain activity was recorded, and a linear support vector machine (SVM) was used to classify which finger was moved.
3.  **Results:** The system achieved an average classification accuracy of 64.8%, with a peak of 70.6% for distinguishing between the middle and ring fingers. This demonstrates a notable improvement over conventional, lower-density EEG systems for such a fine motor task.

### Application for Aetherium (Market Context):

This paper provides the scientific foundation for creating a miniaturized, user-friendly, and economically viable version of this uHD EEG technology. The goal is to translate this research into a mass-market device, like a **mezzanine board for a small System-on-Module (e.g., Seeed Studio XIAO)**. This would make advanced BCI research and application development accessible to hobbyists, students, and independent researchers, moving it out of the exclusive domain of large, well-funded labs.

The in-game "Rune of True Sight" artifact is the magical manifestation of this real-world goal.
