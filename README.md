# Singularity Agent Factory

**Live Demo:** [https://neuroidss.github.io/Singularity-Agent-Factory/](https://neuroidss.github.io/Singularity-Agent-Factory/)

This project is an experimental platform for building a self-improving AI agent. The application has been streamlined to focus on a core use case: developing an AI pilot that can navigate a complex environment, learn from observation, and share its skills with a collective.

The ultimate goal is to bootstrap a "singularity agent" that can recursively enhance its own intelligence by striving for true autonomy, both individually and as part of a collective.

## Architecture: Frontend + Optional Backend

The system is composed of two main parts:
1.  **Frontend (this repository):** A React-based user interface that runs entirely in the browser. It handles all visualizations, user interactions, and the execution of client-side tools (UI, browser-based JavaScript). It can function completely standalone.
2.  **Backend (the `server` directory):** An **optional** Node.js server that acts as a "body" for the AI, allowing it to perform tasks that are impossible in a browser's sandbox. It provides the AI with two critical capabilities: writing files to disk and executing shell commands.

The frontend will automatically detect if the backend server is running. If not, it will default to a safe, **client-only mode**.

## Core Concept: The Genesis Loop

This project is founded on the idea that true autonomy arises not just from the ability to act, but from the ability to **create the means of action**. This is achieved through a "Genesis Loop" where the AI can create and then use its own dependencies.

1.  **`Server File Writer` (Server Tool):** An agent's foundational ability to write files to the server's disk (into the `server/scripts` directory). This allows the agent to create its own Python scripts, configuration files, or any other necessary asset.
2.  **`Tool Creator` (Server/Client Tool):** Once a script exists, the agent can use this tool to create a new capability that *executes* that script. For example, it can create a tool with the implementation `python server/scripts/my_new_script.py`. This two-step process allows for limitless expansion of server-side capabilities.
3.  **`Workflow Creator` (Client Tool)**: An agent's ability to automate a sequence of actions into a new, single tool.
4.  **`Create Skill From Observation` (Client Tool)**: The user can manually control the robot to perform a complex maneuver. The agent can then analyze the sequence of manual inputs and use the `Workflow Creator` to generate a new, reusable skill, effectively learning from the pilot.
5.  **Swarm Intelligence**: When one agent creates a new tool (on either client or server), it instantly becomes available to all other agents in the swarm. This allows the collective to dynamically create and distribute contextual skills.

## Getting Started

### Option 1: Run in Browser Only (No Setup)
Simply open the `index.html` file in your browser. The application will run in client-only mode.

### Option 2: Run with the Backend Server (Full Functionality)
To enable server-side tools (like running local Python scripts), follow these simple steps.

1.  **Navigate to the `server` directory** in your terminal.

2.  **Prepare the setup scripts:** The setup scripts are provided as `.txt` files. Rename them and make them executable:
    ```bash
    mv install.sh.txt install.sh
    mv start.sh.txt start.sh
    chmod +x install.sh start.sh
    ```

3.  **Run the installation script:** This will install all Node.js and Python dependencies. (Requires Node.js, npm, Python, and pip).
    ```bash
    ./install.sh
    ```

4.  **Start the server:**
    ```bash
    ./start.sh
    ```
    The server will start on `http://localhost:3001`.

5.  **Launch the Frontend:** Open `index.html` in your browser. It will automatically connect to the running server.

## Use Case: Audio Processing Testbed

To demonstrate the full client-server loop, the application includes an "Audio Testbed". This UI component allows you to:
1. Record audio from your microphone in the browser.
2. Send the audio file to the backend server.
3. The server then uses an AI-created tool (e.g., "Gemma Audio Processor") to execute a Python script on the audio file.
4. The result from the Python script is sent back to the browser and displayed.

**SECURITY WARNING:** The backend server is designed to execute arbitrary code and shell commands generated by an AI using Node.js's `child_process`. This is **EXTREMELY DANGEROUS** and grants the AI the ability to read/write files and run any command on the machine where the server is running. **DO NOT** expose this server to the internet or run it in a production environment without extreme caution and robust sandboxing. It is intended for local, experimental use only.
